#Dashboard Design Practice
# we can create a dashboard to monitor browser app like springbootapp, angular ,react and so on. we can create a dashboard to monitor our backend called Application Performance Monitor (APM) /Backend services. create a dashboard to monitor (Host, Network, Disk etc) 

#Browser Application

Alerting in Grafana
Alert Rules, Notification Policies, & Contact Points
Alert are raised when a defined rules is violated
Rules are defined as query and are checked by Alert manager
promql against prom instances

Alert are sent to Notification policies to contact points


#########
working with Alert rules
in alert rules you defined your alert. Reduce expression converts all data points to one value 
pending period :  A threshold or rules or math for a period of uptime before it raises alert, This is in order to avoid false alert


######
